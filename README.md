# Gaussian-Naive-Bayes

## Creation of a Gaussian Naive Bayes Classifier paired with a dataset of Iris flower data

### What I learned:

#### Cross validation with n folds
###### Learned how to split the dataset into folds and get the accuracy metric of the function

#### How to create a function to evaluate the functionality of the algorithm
###### I learned to pair the cross validation with the accuracy and get the overall effectiveness of the machine learning algorithm,
###### which is a skill that can be applied to much more than just the Gaussian Naive Bayes model I learned

#### Creating a normally distributed (Gaussian) model
###### Finally, I learned how to make a Gaussian model so that I can go further in creating normal distributions of data in the future,
###### wherein I can make more deterministic programs on data in the future.

#### Naive Bayes Classification
###### Overall, I combined these skills and more functions to actually help make a determination given example data.
###### This was very valuable in being my first major Python project where I took a risk at an unfamiliar topic.


####
### Iris Dataset

#### Composed of 5 columns of data

##### Column 1: Sepal length in cm
##### Column 2: Sepal width in cm
##### Column 3: Petal length in cm
##### Column 4: Petal width in cm
##### Column 5: Class

## Process
### Using online tutorials and my own statistical reasoning, created a model to predict which class of flower an example would be based on the data in the table
